{"short_summary":"Sengoku complains about Kuma's sparing of the Straw Hats, but Garp is confident that they will not talk about defeating Moria. The Straw Hats reach the Red Line, on the other side of the world from where they entered the Grand Line, and briefly reflect on how far they have come and just how far they have to go. Robin, Brook, and Luffy investigate with the Shark Submerge III to see how they could get to Fish-Man Island but are unable to go deep enough to find any clues. A Sea Rabbit attacks them, and after they defeat it, it spits out a mermaid named Camie and her starfish pet, Pappag."}
