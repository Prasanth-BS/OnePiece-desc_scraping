Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses his Gum-Gum Pistol technique on Alvida. Luffy and Coby sail away in a \"borrowed\" boat from Alvida's crew. Luffy asks about the pirate hunter Coby mentioned earlier. Coby says that he was captured by the Marines, and Luffy announces his intention of asking him to join his crew."

She tells them how Helmeppo brought his vicious pet dog into their bar and that Zoro knocked it out to protect everyone inside. He then made a deal with Helmeppo: if he can survive being tied to a pole with no food or water for thirty days, then Helmeppo will spare the little girl and her mother. However, Helmeppo says that he will execute Zoro the next day despite his word. Luffy punches him, and Helmeppo runs off to tell his father.

Shanks tells Luffy that he just ate the Gum Gum Fruit, a Devil Fruit, and now he is a rubber man and won't be able to ever swim again. Later, Luffy gets attacked by Higuma and his bandits. He is about to be killed, when Shanks and his crew arrive and effortlessly defeat Higuma's men. Frightened, Higuma throws down a smoke bomb and makes his escape, taking Luffy with him. He flees out to sea in a boat. There he throws the non-swimmer into the water. As Higuma laughs at Luffy's plight, a Sea King appears behind him and devours him whole.

As the pirates get ready to leave, Luffy decides he will become a pirate on his own, that he will gather a crew that will beat Shanks', and that he will become King of the Pirates.

Later, by a cliff overlooking the ocean, Luffy and Usopp witness Jango and Klahadore — whose true identity turns out to be that of the infamous pirate Captain Kuro—plotting a raid of the village and a murder of Kaya. Luffy yells at them not to get rid of Kaya, but Jango uses his hypnotism to put Luffy to sleep, causing him to fall off the cliff. He lands on his head and appears to be dead.

Meanwhile, Kuro breaks the glasses Kaya gave him and injures Merry with his clawed glove. Kuro then steps into Kaya's room, and he holds his blood-stained claw over Kaya's head, remembering the deed he has to commit the following day. By the coast, the Black Cat Pirates' ship approaches Syrup Village. Jango reiterates the plan to his men. Meanwhile, Luffy, Usopp, Zoro, and Nami stand on the slope leading to the village, and have poured a barrel of oil on it to make it slippery. The plan is that when the Black Cat Pirates slip on the oil, the four will spring out and attack them. Dawn breaks, and so the Black Cat Pirates land on the coast, spotting Luffy's boat. At that moment, Luffy and the others are waiting for the pirates as the sun has now risen, and Nami hears the pirates coming from the north. Usopp notes that there is an identical slope at the north end of the village, and they realize they are at the wrong coast. Panicking, Nami then realizes that their ship is located at the north coast, and their treasure will be robbed by the pirates. Luffy and Usopp take off running for the coast. Zoro and Nami start to leave, but Nami slips on the oil and drags Zoro down the slope, stepping on him to climb back up. Zoro is unable to get up the slippery slope, and he slides to the bottom, but eventually uses his swords to pull his way up. At the north coast, Usopp arrives, surprised that Luffy hasn't come yet, who is now lost. The Black Cat Pirates arrive, and Usopp stands up to them, but realizes he can't beat them by himself. He sees the pirates taking the treasure from the Straw Hats' ship, and he says that the treasure belongs to him, and he'll give it to them if they leave. Jango decides to hypnotize Usopp instead, but Nami arrives in the nick of time and whacks Usopp in the head, knocking him over, refusing to give up her treasure. Usopp then reports that Luffy has not arrived yet, and is probably lost. The Black Cat Pirates then charge, and Usopp stands up to them, but they knock him down swiftly. Usopp struggles to fight them, but there are far too many. He is shocked when they are all sent flying back, and sees that Luffy and Zoro have arrived. Zoro yells at Nami about leaving him there, and Luffy yells at Usopp for not telling him which was north. However, united, the four face off against the invading Black Cat Pirates."

    "episodeDescription": "Jango kneels beside the fallen pirates and starts to hypnotize them. Once the hypnotism takes effect, the pirates became wild and ravenous, and foaming at their mouths, they charge at the Straw Hats. One pounds down a cliff with his fist. Zoro says that he and Luffy will handle it, but Luffy was also hypnotized, becoming a wild animal himself. Luffy charges down the slope and uses his Gum Gum Gatling technique to plow through the pirates with ease. Luffy keeps charging, and soon runs past the pirates, causing Jango to fear that he will be the next target. Luffy takes the bow of Kuro's ship in an attempt to kill him, but Jango hypnotizes Luffy, and so Luffy falls asleep, the bow falling on top of him and squishing him as he does this. With Luffy out of the way, Jango prepares for the next attack. Seeing the pirates are defeated, he calls for Siam and Butchie and orders them to attack. They turn out to be cowards, but after some heavy persuasion they charge for Zoro. Zoro blocks their claws with his sword, and engages in a great fight with the two Meowban Brothers. Zoro slashes Siam through the lowersection, but finds out Siam has a very thin waist. He sits on top of Zoro and Buchie leaps down, but Zoro manages to avoid the bone-crushing attack that leaves a crater. Butchie then uses his cat-like abilities to steal Zoro's two swords, and throws them away. Zoro has no chance to grab them and faces another assault by the Nyaban Brothers. Usopp decides to help and fires at the brothers, but Zoro blocks it with his back, yelling at Nami and Usopp to not get themselves killed. Nami then runs for Zoro's swords, picking them up, but Jango reacts swiftly and slashes her in the shoulder with his chakram. Just as Jango and the others are about to kill the Straw Hats, Kuro appears, annoyed that his plan has foiled."

They charge at Kuro but only swing at thin air, and Kuro appears behind them, holding his claws to their necks. He says that everyone has five minutes to finish their job, or he will kill them all. He releases the Meowban Brothers, pushing them so that they can continue their battle with Zoro. However, Nami sees her chance and kicks Zoro's swords through the air. Zoro catches them, and as the Meowban Brothers charge at him he unleashes a great Toragiri, taking both of them down with one mighty swing. He turns to Kuro and declares he won't even need five minutes. Nami realizes how dangerous Kuro is, and so runs to wake up Luffy. As she runs, Jango spots her, and hurls a chakram at her. Nami turns and steps on Luffy's face, waking up Luffy abruptly. He springs up, pulling Nami down just as the chakram strikes him right in the mouth. Luffy stays standing, though, and he breaks the chakram with his teeth. He then sees Nami is wounded, and furious, prepares for battle with Kuro. At the mansion, Kaya wakes up from a nightmare, and she heads down the stairs to find Merry leaning against the wall, bloody and wounded. Merry explains the whole situation to Kaya, how Kuro is planning to take kill her and take her money in a will. Kaya realizes that Usopp was telling the truth the entire time, and so she puts on her overcoat and sets out. She arrives at the top of the slope, and tells Kuro to stop immediately, and that Merry told her everything. Kuro turns to her and wonders why Merry isn't dead, and Kaya sees the state Usopp is in. Usopp charges in and aims a punch at Kuro's face, but Kuro avoids the swing and so Usopp careens into the ground. Kaya then pulls out a gun and points it at Kuro, ordering him to leave the village. Kuro reminds Kaya of the fun times they had together, and Kaya hesitates. Kuro takes the gun from Kaya's hands, knowing she won't shoot, and he drops it to the ground. Usopp picks up the gun and fires at Kuro, but Kuro sidesteps the shot and knocks Usopp down. From out of nowhere flies Luffy's fist, striking Kuro in the face. As Kuro falls back, Luffy retracts his arm and declares that he has a hundred more where that came from."

Jango hurls his chakram and cuts down many trees, searching everywhere for them, and Kaya falls down. She tells the Usopp Pirates to run before they are killed, but they stay and fight, deciding to follow their captain's orders and fight to the death for Kaya. Back at the slope, Kuro claims that he hated being a pirate. Luffy refuses to be like him and Kuro uses his Silent Step to move quickly. Luffy gets the timing right, however, and pounds Kuro down. Kuro gets back up and announces that he is going to kill his entire crew, and that it was part of his plan from the beginning. Luffy claims that Usopp could beat Kuro. Kuro laughs it off and uses Shakushi, causing him to disappear. As Luffy wonders where he went, Nami finishes up looting the Black Cat pirate ship, disappointed by the amount of treasure. She then wonders if the battle is over, but sees that Kuro slashes through several of his crewmates, taking them down quicker than the naked eye can see. Luffy gets even more angry, but just after Kuro slashes him in the chest, he grabs Kuro's arm and slams him onto the ground. Kuro stands up and says that now his crew is suffering because Luffy wouldn't let them die quickly, and so Kuro uses Shakushi once again to disappear. In the forest, at that moment, Jango continues searching for the Usopp Pirates, and they toss him a white flag. Jango walks forward and so the Usopp Pirates launch their ambush. Jango trips over a rope and one of the Usopp Pirates showers him with pepper, making him sneeze. The second jumps out and strikes Jango in the groin with a frying pan. The third leaps down from a large rock and takes a swing at Jango's head, but Jango sits up in time and knocks his attacker away. Kaya then comes out, telling Jango not to hurt the kids, but Jango reports that it was his orders from Kuro to kill the children. Kaya then grabs Jango's chakram and holds it in front of her throat, threatening to kill herself without writing the will. Jango agrees, and so he gets Kaya to write the will. Once finished, he grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree, holding up a chakram to kill her. Zoro is still running through the woods with Usopp on his back, and Usopp spots Jango. Kuro slices up the rocks, followed by cutting up Luffy's left shoulder as he glances in anger as the episode ends."

As he is doing so, Luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship, and holds it up. It's a terribly drawn skull and crossbones, of course. The others are horrified of the artwork, and so Usopp tells them that he is a great painter. He paints a pirate flag with his own face on it, but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag, a very nice one at that. They fly it on the mast and continue to sail. As they are sailing, Nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope, saying it is Legendary Treasure Island. Usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island, but if one tries to claim it they will face God's wrath. As the Straw Hats draw nearer to the island, the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy. After a tough sail they make it to the island. The Straw Hats head into the jungle, looking for treasure. Zoro lies down and starts to nap, and as Usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this, the Straw Hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals, creatures that are combinations of two or more animals. A voice booms through the jungle, claiming to be the Guardian God of the island and telling them to leave. Luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face. The voice is shocked and Luffy explains he ate the Devil's Fruit. A gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots Luffy in the back, but Luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his Gum Gum powers. Luffy then spots a twitching green bush, and the owner of the voice takes off running. Luffy, Usopp, and Nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest, named Gaimon. Luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the Grand Line and claim One Piece, but Gaimon doesn't think he can do it. Luffy and Gaimon converse about how they can't read a map, and Nami is angered by this. Gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as Zoro finally joins them. He explains that twenty years ago, he was with his crew in search of the treasure, and as they were leaving, he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff. Gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell, getting stuck in a treasure box. He found that his crew had left, and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself, but found he could not climb in the box. When Luffy tries to pull Gaimon out of the box, he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box, and his body will be ruined if the box is broken. Luffy then realizes that Gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors. Inspired by Gaimon's story, the Straw Hats decide to help Gaimon find the treasure. They come to the ridge and Luffy uses Gum Gum Rocket to launch himself up to the top, where there are five treasure chests. He refuses to hand them over to Gaimon, and while this shocks and angers Nami and Usopp, Gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty. Luffy confirms this, and so Gaimon begins to cry, saying that he's been guarding nothing for twenty years. Luffy says it could be worse, as he could have died guarding nothing, and he offers Gaimon to join their crew. Gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island, however, as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure. With this adventure behind them, the Straw Hats set sail in the Going Merry once again, waving goodbye to Gaimon as the episode draws to a close."

In the meantime, on the Going Merry, Zoro recognizes the intruder who got beat up by Luffy from the last episode as Johnny. Johnny then brings the straw hat pirates' attention to Yosaku, who lies ill on his and Johnny's small ship. Turns out that Johnny, Yosaku, and Zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago. Johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took Yosaku to a small rock island to rest, which was coincidentally blown up by Usopp and Luffy for target practice in the last episode. Usopp and Luffy quickly apologize. Johnny, however, was more worried about Yosaku's condition, which Nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of Vitamin C. Luffy and Usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into Yosaku's mouth and Yosaku is revived!... or at least for 5 minutes. The straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems. Johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as Baratie. He also states that the one Zoro has been looking for, Hawk-eyes Mihawk, is near there too. Thus they head to Baratie, which actually is pretty much right next to where they were. They are then passed by Fullbody's marine ship. Fullbody doesn't recognize the straw hat pirates mark, but he recognizes Johnny and Yosaku as worthless pirate hunters. Johnny responds by shouting \"this is what pirate hunters do\" while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air. Nami takes note of the Arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands. Fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship. Luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chief's room in Baratie, where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that Luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year. In Baratie, while attempting to impress his girlfriend, Fullbody instead becomes humiliated by Sanji's witty remarks. Turns out that Sanji is actually the Assistant Head Chef. Frustrated, Fullbody destroys his table full of food. Sanji, who is angry that Fullbody wasted precious food, beats Fullbody up."

The head chef then kicks Sanji to calm him down and also kicks Fullbody out of the restaurant. Fullbody's subordinate then comes running into the restaurant yelling that their prisoner, a member of Don Krieg's pirates, has escaped. The customers are terrified because Don Krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in East Blue. The pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food. Patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him. The pirate points a gun at Patty and says \"is a bullet okay?\" Patty then beats the pirate up and doesn't recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money. Sanji, on the other hand, heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal. Fullbody in the meantime, leaves the restaurant sneakily (along with the subordinate who got shot earlier, guess he is still alive). Sanji brings his meal to the pirate, who was thrown out by Patty. Sanji states that, for him, a customer is anybody who is hungry. He also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else. The pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up, while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life. Luffy, who was watching the whole thing, attempts to recruit Sanji as the cook for his crew. After refusing and some conversing, we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame. Luffy, as always, is stubborn and insists that Sanji joins them. We also find out that the other pirate's name is Gin. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, we learn that Don Krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships. Gin thanks Sanji for the meal and leaves. Sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that Sanji is giving out food for free, which makes Gin even more grateful. Luffy is then sent back to work, where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen. The rest of the crew, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp, turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant. Sanji, after seeing Nami, is captivated by her beauty. While flirting with Nami, the head chef tells Sanji that he's annoying and that he doesn't need him anymore. Meanwhile, Gin informs Don Krieg of the restaurant, where Don Krieg makes clear his intention to \"visit\" the restaurant."

He says that she doesn't have the right to tell him when or how she can die, and she tries to attack him with her broken sword. She misses and Law prepares to slice her into more pieces. Luckily, Smoker steps in and takes on a fight with Law. Back at Luffy's group, the beaten centaurs talk about how they underestimated the Straw Hats and how they took Brownbeard with them. While they contemplate on that, Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Robin, and Usopp ride Brownbeard to the mysterious building that Brook saw. In the lab, a hazmat guy tells the mysterious smoke man that Law and Smoker were in a fight and that the children escaped with Nami's group, and that Smoker saw the children. The smoke man became very angry but knew that if he tried to kill Smoker, the navy would think that something was up. Just then, the Harpy that Usopp saw, Monet, informs the smoke man that the pirates they captured were the Straw Hats and that Luffy's group beat Vegapunk's dragon and the centaurs and were on their way to the facility. The smoke man finally decides to kill the Straw Hats and the G-5. Although the hazmat guy warns him that the navy would be on the alert, the smoke man's says they would just have to suppress things on the island from now on. He then tells Monet to call a man called Joker. Back with Sanji's group, the children begin to realize that Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky switched bodies. They also start to get cold. Sanji states that he doesn't care about anyone anymore and asks if someone has a camera so he can take a picture of himself in Nami's body. When a child falls and complains that it is cold, Franky begins to say that it was a bad idea to bring the kids if they didn't have a plan. Back at the main entrance to the facility, Smoker and Law are still fighting as the G-5 are watching and putting themselves back together outside Law's bubble. As the fighting continues, the G-5 try to figure out why Law was fighting them even though he was a warlord. Tashigi tries to fight, and the G-5 stop her. She then reflects on what Smoker told her two years ago: \"Pirates will be pirates.\" Closing in on the fight, Smoker and Law fight so viciously, that Law's recoils cut up everything in the way. Smoker then begins to ask him why he was on the island, with Law saying nothing. Back to Tashigi, she begins to remember what Smoker said after the incident at Enies lobby. She remembers him saying that they have to be promoted and that he would kick the asses of the Straw Hats in the New World. In the fight, Smoker tells Law that he never trusted the Warlords and as Smoker charges at him, Law says under his breath, \"Maybe that's the right thing to do,\" and begins to make stone spikes rise from the ground in Smoker's direction to get him. Although Smoker was able to dodge most of them, Law rises one from under him and Smoker gets jabbed. As he drops his jitte, Smoker once again asks why Law was on the island and the two begin to fight again. Law finally answers the question by asking why the G-5 were here. Law pushes Smoker back and Smoker tries to jab Law but instead breaks through a stone spike that Law rose from the ground. As he ducks from the attack, Law tell Smoker that from his current standing he couldn't see a few things and poked out his heart. Law takes the heart and his sword and says that he doesn't have to say anything to Smoker. With his heart outside of his body, Smoker collapses."

After regaining their senses, the G-5 marines then turn their guns and swords towards the Straw Hats preparing to arrest them. Nami notices Law and demands him to switch back her and Sanji's body, to which Sanji secretly refuses.

Law then explains to everyone present that they only have two hours to escape, he then continues by saying the only passage that leads safely leads out of the island is called R-66 and is found in Room R. The marines were reluctant, but quickly changes their mind when Smoker repeated the order to them. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of the men and rescue the children as he goes to confront Vergo. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown is celebrating the deaths of his victims but notices that the cage has no solidified bodies, which he needed to prove the power of Shinokuni. He also notices the absence of the G-5 Marines. Vergo states that Luffy and the others must have broken out of the cage and helped the G-5 soldiers' escape. Before Luffy went to fight Caesar again, Zoro calls out to Luffy reminding him that this is just the beginning of the New World and he mustn't let his guard down again, and Luffy happily complies as he plows through the Satyr soldiers. Caesar Clown then receives the news that the Straw Hats and Marines have broken into the Lab, leaving him alarmed and flabbergasted at their escape."

The dwarfs all agree that Doflamingo's presence is a terrible thing for the country, and that an incident framed King Doldo III as a villain so he is undeservedly hated by Dressrosa today. Finally, the Thunder Soldier reveals that he is Rebecca's father."

Ten years ago Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers, asking for a 10 billion Beli ransom, in order to leave the country alone. Riku sent his soldiers to ask of the citizens' money, but while they were willingly trying to help their king, Doflamingo controlled Riku and his soldiers with his ability, and made them attack their own people against their will.

Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island.

He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them. Thunder Soldier also explains that the reason for their rebellion was the news of Doflamingo resignation was false, shocking Usopp, Robin and Franky, who realize they unintentionally caused the rebellion. In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren.

Later, Doflamingo informs his crew that they will be moving their base toward Reverse Mountain while expanding their business. As they were moving across the sea, they engaged in combat with the Marines and pulled bank heists. At one point, Law and Baby 5 were attacked by a pirate named Wellington, but were saved by Doflamingo and his executives.

Doflamingo then attacks Rebecca but she's teleported away by Law. As their battle resumes, Doflamingo relentlessly attacks Luffy with string and takes control of him. Luffy starts to remember that during his training with Rayleigh, he fought an opponent too big for the Kong Gun to work on,  and Rayleigh told him that he needed to come up with something else. Luffy realizes that his Kong Gun isn't enough to beat Doflamingo. Doflamingo tells Luffy that they should have all just stayed in his cage and submitted to his manipulation, saying that humans should only live when a divine being like him manipulates them. He says that he would not have had to carry out this massacre if they had not cut their puppet strings, but Luffy has had enough with his talk. Luffy breaks free by activating Fourth Gear and flies into the air, where he declares his disgust to Doflamingo on how he manipulates everyone and makes it feel like he's suffocating, and the Shichibukai says that the people here were born as trash and are meant to be manipulated. Luffy tells him to be quiet as he retracts his forearm, and Doflamingo creates a web to protect himself. Luffy then blows air into his other arm, making the retracted arm even bigger, as he remembers sharing his idea for an improved Kong Gun with Rayleigh, as he prepares to deliver the final blow. Doflamingo creates sixteen string spears imbued with Armament Haki for a final attack of his own. Doflamingo uses his God Thread technique and Luffy unleashes his Gum-Gum King Kong Gun. The clash between Luffy and the strings is powerful enough to cause ripples in the water and be felt by the citizens below, and everyone on Dressrosa cheers Luffy on as he breaks through Doflamingo's attack and defense before hitting Doflamingo himself. The force of the punch sends Doflamingo flying into the ground, with the impact tearing apart the city, and Doflamingo falls down into the underground harbor. Law looks up at Luffy and remembers how Corazon once told him in some countries, there are people who call those with the name of \"D.\", the sworn enemy of the gods as Doflamingo's shattered glasses fall away and Luffy hovers in the air victorious."
